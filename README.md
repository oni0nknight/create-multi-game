# Game

**Setup**

Install dependencies with `npm install`

You also need to have parcel installed globally.
Use `npm install -g parcel-bundler`

**How to play**

- Build the client app with `npm run build-client`
- Then launch the server with `npm run server`

To start a game, players can now connect to your server.  
The browser will download the client app which will in turn connect to the socketio server automatically.

**Development**

During development, use the two following commands to benefit from live reload.  
`npm run start-client`  
`npm run start-server`
